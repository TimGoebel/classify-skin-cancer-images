# classify_skin_cancer_images

This repository contains a machine learning pipeline that processes image data, trains multiple models (VGG16, ResNet50, InceptionV3, EfficientNetB0, and DenseNet121), and performs post-processing to evaluate the results.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/TimGoebel/classify_skin_cancer_images
.git
    cd classify_skin_cancer_images
    ```

2. Install the required Python packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

To run the pipeline, you need to have a directory structure where the image data is stored in a folder named `data` within the current working directory. The pipeline will preprocess the data, train the models, and then apply post-processing.

### Running the Pipeline

Execute the following command to start the pipeline:

```bash
python main.py
```

### Arguments

- `directory`: The directory containing the `data` folder. The script will automatically use the current working directory if not specified.
- `target_name`: The name of the folder containing the image data. Default is `data`.

## Directory Structure

The expected directory structure is as follows:
create folders:
data
models
plots
reports

## Scripts Overview

- **`main.py`**: The main script that orchestrates the entire pipeline trains all the models.
- **`preprocessing.py`**: Handles data preprocessing, including resizing images.
- **`model_VGG.py`**: Contains the function to train a VGG16 model and plots.
- **`model_resnet50.py`**: Contains the function to train a ResNet50 model and plots.
- **`model_inceptionV3.py`**: Contains the function to train an InceptionV3 model and plots.
- **`model_efficientnet.py`**: Contains the function to train an EfficientNetB0 model and plots.
- **`model_densenet.py`**: Contains the function to train a DenseNet model and plots.
- **`post_processing.py`**: Handles the post-processing steps, such as generating confusion matrices and classification reports and ensembling models 2 at a time and runs throughs all of them at once.
